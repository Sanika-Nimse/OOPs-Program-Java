# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:-

## Description

This Java project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical examples. It aims to provide a clear understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, showcasing how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios.


## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases the following OOP concepts:

* **Encapsulation:**
    * Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
    * Using access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `public`, `protected`) to control data access and maintain data integrity.
    * Example: [Provide a brief example from your code, e.g., "The `Book` class encapsulates the `title`, `author`, and `ISBN` attributes, and provides methods to access and modify them."]
* **Inheritance:**
    * Creating new classes (subclasses/derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses/base classes).
    * Enabling code reusability and establishing "is-a" relationships between classes.
    * Example: [Provide a brief example from your code, e.g., "The `EBook` class inherits from the `Book` class, adding a `fileFormat` attribute specific to electronic books."]
* **Polymorphism:**
    * The ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
    * Achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
    * Example: [Provide a brief example from your code, e.g., "The `LibraryItem` interface defines a `displayInfo()` method, which is implemented differently by the `Book` and `DVD` classes, demonstrating runtime polymorphism."]
* **Abstraction:**
    * Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features.
    * Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
    * Example: [Provide a brief example from your code, e.g., "The `Shape` abstract class defines the `calculateArea()` method, which is implemented by concrete subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle`."]

## Features

* Clear and concise examples of each OOP concept.
* Well-structured and commented code for easy understanding.
* Demonstration of practical application of OOP principles.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) [Specify version, e.g., 11 or 17] or higher.
